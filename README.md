# RESTful Todo
RESTful Todo API with [Actix](https://actix.rs) and [SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/). Documented by [swagger-ui](https://swagger.io/). Authenticated by [JWT](https://jwt.io/). Rate limited by [actix_extensible_rate_limit](https://crates.io/crates/actix_extensible_rate_limit). Tested by [rstest](https://crates.io/crates/rstest). Have fun! üòÅ
### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Usage
Clone the repository and run the following commands:

RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

- `just fmt` to format everything
- `just fmt-check` to check the format of everything
- `just linter` to run Rust linter (clippy)
- `just tests` to run the tests

## Soon
- [X] Swagger UI for API documentation
- [X] Rate limiting
- [ ] CI with Github Actions
- [X] Unit tests
- [ ] Dockerize the server
- [X] JustFile for easy setup, useing [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
